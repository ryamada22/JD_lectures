    "### The last step of stepwise method returns the same result with LASSO and Ridge with their regularization parameter  /lambda=0/lambda=0 . How do the plots show this phenomenon? This \"goal\" is \"Full Model\".\n",
    "+ The last step in stepwise method (forward stepwise method) is increasing the subset size to reach the minimum sum of squares $||y-\\hat{y}||^2$. With the $\\lambda=0$, $\\hat{\\beta}$ equals to $\\hat{\\beta}_{LS}$ in the LASSO and Ridge, of which is similar to the full model of stepwise method with maximum subsite size $k$. It is shown by the plots with the similarity of general directions of the lines in the plots with the increasing number of $df(\\lambda)$\n",

    "### How do the plots show \"subset selection\" of stepwise and LASSO methods ?\n",
    "+ We can see the performance of \"subset selection\" of stepwise and LASSO methods with the different colors and how it branches from the middle zero line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do the plots show \"no subset selection\" of Ridge method?\n",
    "+ All the lines in the Ridge Regression method plot came from one origination point with all the variable at 0 and varies along as the $df(\\lambda)$ changes\n",

    "### Parameter k of kNN method is a smoothing parameter for vias-variance tradeoff. See [kNN Classification](../cells/kNN_Classification.ipynb) and desicribe k as a regularization factor.\n",
    "+ kNN method allows changes in value averages according to. Assuming each point in the example plots from kNN Classification are separate regression run with different $df(\\lambda)$ and different sum of squares, changes in $k$ can regulates the average of coefficient of the variables, therefore can act as regularization factor."
