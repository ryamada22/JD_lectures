I have gone throught these code as assignment.
These document intruduce the three cllasification method.

ELinere regression
The two classes to be classified are represented as the numbers 0 or 1.
These values is handled as objective variable (y) of linear regression.
When predicted value by the model >= 0.5, that sample is classified the class 1.
When predicted value by the model < 0.5, that sample is classified the class 0.
Training data with class label is required for this method.
Then, separation boundary surface becomes a plane.

EK-means method
Unlike liner regression, training data with class label is not required.
Since classifying samples based on the distance from the center of gravity of each class, separation boundary surface becomes a plane.


ESupport Vector Machine Classifier
Training data with class label is required for this method.
The cost function to be minimized is different with linear regression using the least squares method.
The separation boundary surface becomes a plane, but by combining kernel method, it can be non-linear boundary surface.
