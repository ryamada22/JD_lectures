    "One of the purposes of machine learning is construct the model to understand the given dataset and predict the unknown dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least two points to be evaluated. One is internal validity that explains the accuracy of the model of the given dataset. The other is external validity that generalizes the model to any dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the model has many or the equal number of parameters to the samples (size of training dataset), the model can express the dataset almost completely. However, this model cannot be generalized because this model is too much fiited to training set. This model is not useful other than training set.\n",
