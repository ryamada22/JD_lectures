#1 <write an explanation on bias and variance and their tradeoff in machine learning to somebody who are new to machine learning.>

The goal of machine learning algorithm is to learn a reasonable estimation mapping from training data to test data.
The bias and variance are used as an evaluation of the algorithm when simultaneously considering the fit to the training data and suppression of overfitting.

In repeated learning process, algorithm converges to some particular answer.
But it is different from the truth.
This deviation of the answer from the truth is called "bias".
The bias is an error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm.
High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting).

In repeated learnig process, each learing results are deviated from the answer.
It varies around 0, and the variation is called "Variance".
The variance is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. 
High variance can cause an algorithm to model the random noise in the training data, rather than the intended outputs (overfitting).

The biasâ€“variance tradeoff is the problem of simultaneously minimizing two sources of error that prevent supervised learning algorithms from generalizing beyond their training sets.
If the model is simple, the bias becomes small but the variance becomes large.
If the model is complex, the variance becomes small but the bias becomes large. 
In other words, we can make a good prediction by finding a moderately complex model that minimizes mean square error
