    "The panels explained the change of beta value relative to the the degree of freedom.  \n",
    "+ For the Stepwise graphic, the low degree of freedom resulted in high beta value in order to predict the result from the data. As no penalty on Stepwise Regression, the beta value selected tend to be large to minimize the sum of squares. Introducing additional parameter changes the estimated beta value. In Stepwise, the addition of parameter increased one, each step.\n",
    "+ The panel for Ridge Regression describe that this method optimizes beta value to minimize the sum of squares without selection. The beta value is regularized by $\\lambda ||\\beta||^2$. In ridge regression, the parameter with less significance for the model based on the data will have smaller beta, minimized closed to zero.\n",
    "+ LASSO panel describing a regularization, that resulted in smaller beta compared to Stepwise Regression, and selection, by minimizing the beta value down to zero. Different with Stepwise regression that change the number of parameters one by one, LASSO panel reveals that the change of degrees of freedom can be one step or more than one step at a time."
