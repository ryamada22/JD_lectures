<p>Linear regression is a kind of statistical techniques to estimate the relationship between an objective variable and explanatory variables. Its main characteristics is straightness such as a straight line and a flat plane.

The validation of this LSM calculation is based on the independence of each error which supposed to follow normal distribution.</p>
