<p>If you assume that each observations are generated from normal distributions and are independent, and try to predict the function which generate the gained observation at maximum possibility, the procedure is called linear regression. This is because normal distribution, which is usually used to examine random errors, is defined by sum of squares, and multiplication of the density function is the exponential of a sum of squares.</p>
