<p>Linear regression is a method that tries to describe observation(independent variable) and using linear predictor functions as the model (a straight line) to predict the relationship (predicted variable). It focuses on the conditional probability distribution of the response given the values of the predictors. The linear regression handles the situation is to measure the distance between the line and the dot. To get the minimal distance for all the dot, we can sum up all the X2 and see if it is the smallest one and continue the process until the goal achieved. It is called the least squares approach. Also, the probability distribution of the predictor variables x has a major influence on the precision of estimates.</p>  <p> </p>
