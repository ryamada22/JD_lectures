<p>Linear regression is to try to find a straight line or flat to explain the relationship between several variables (&gt;=2). In order to find the best linear regression model, we would like to minimize the sum of squares of the deviations between observations and predictions. Why we use sum of squares is because if the random errors of the observations obey normal distribution, then transformation of squares can be explained as the probability of observations equal prediction. This method is based on 2 assumptions, which are (1) as having said, the random errors of observations obey normal distribution, (2) they are independent with each other. Due to 1, the sum of squares can be interpreted as the probability of all the observations can be exactly explained by the model (we would like to maximize it); due to 2, the conditional probability can be calculated by multiplication of probabilities. </p>
