Kernel density estimation is one of nonparametric methods 
for estimating the probability density function of a random variable from sample data.
This method estimate probability density function 
by adding kernel functions around each sample point. 
The formula of the kernel function and band width which determine how far each data point exist affect density estimation, 
are determined by the user.
