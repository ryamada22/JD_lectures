```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(igraph)
```


Making the matrix that can be converted to a graph that is connected.
```{r}
S<-sample(0:8,100,replace = TRUE)
S_m<-matrix(S,10,10)
g<-graph.adjacency(S_m,mode = "undirected",weighted = TRUE)
g

```
Plotting the graph.
```{r}
plot(g)
```



Useing the mst() to generate the minimum spanning tree.
```{r}
mst<-mst(g,weights = E(g)$weight,algorithm="prim")
mst
```

Comapring three mode in mst plotting.
No option
```{r}
plot(mst)
```

Option : graph = "nsca"
```{r}
plot(mst,graph = "nsca")
```

Option : graph = "circle" 
```{r}
plot(mst, graph = "circle")
```
