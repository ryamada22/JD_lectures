```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(igraph)
library(markovchain)
```

## 
Setting the status at the beggining and transition matrix as M.
```{r}
Status<- matrix(c(1000,200,50),1,3)
Status

M<-matrix(c(0.7,0.2, 0.1,0.1,0.6,0.3,0.2,0.2,0.6),3,3)

```

## 
Transition matrix put into "marcovchain" in order to simulate n times changes.
```{r}
dtmcA <- new("markovchain", transitionMatrix = M,
             states = c("A","B","C"),
             name = "Transition") #create the DTMC

```

If the change happened twice, the result of status is similated below. 
```{r}
n<-2
M_2<-dtmcA^n
Ms_2<-as.matrix(M_2@transitionMatrix)

Result<-Status%*%Ms_2
Result

```

```{r}
plot(dtmcA,edge.width=dtmcA@transitionMatrix*5,vertex.color="yellow",vertex.size=as.matrix(Result)*0.25,edge.curved=TRUE,loop.angle=pi/2)

```
